<b><i>"Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and thought has found words."</i></b>

I like to listen to various gerns songs  and  poems which bring me a smile on my face every time I hear,
one of my best poems is "what a wonderful word".

It's talked about appreciating the beauty surroundings of us and it's a line from the title that " I think about myself, it's a wonderful world " that remembers well.
It's sung European artist "JackLuck More" in 1993 but there has many more versions published by various artists.
It's was the biggest-selling songs in the USA and reached the number 1 spot of the year.


I think the first time I heard on youtube when I was looking super hit poem and this one came up with suggestions.
I was mesmerized by the lyrics and the singer's soothing voice.
It's a line that impacts my life in such a way that every small thing matter in life and it makes me happy.
This world is not perfect but it's wounderful and each person has their opinion on each thing.

Whenever I feel stress at that time I go outside and feel each creature of god and think a positive way that how I am lucky that God gives me Wonderful life it feels me relax, clam, and stress free and motivate me.

I also greateful all peopele in my life who make this world so much more wonderful to me.
